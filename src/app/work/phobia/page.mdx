## Overview

BMJ Consultants was struggling with an outdated farm management system that was:

- Taking 30+ seconds to load basic information
- Crashing frequently during data entry
- Confusing for new staff to learn
- Missing critical features they needed

Their team was spending more time fighting with the software than actually managing farms. They needed a solution that could handle data from 600+ farms without breaking a sweat.

   - Easy sharing of reports

## Results

The new system transformed how BMJ Consultants manages their farms:
