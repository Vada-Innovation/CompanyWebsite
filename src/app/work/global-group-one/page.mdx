## Overview

Global Group One came to us with a vision: make their auto BDC service completely digital. Their old system involved endless phone calls, paper schedules, and manual payment tracking. They needed a modern platform that could handle everything from customer bookings to employee scheduling.

The challenge? Build a system that's powerful enough for staff but simple enough for customers. It needed to:

- Make booking appointments as easy as ordering pizza
- Give managers real-time views of employee schedules and performance
- Handle subscription payments smoothly
- Look professional and trustworthy to potential clients

- Manages billing cycles automatically

  Vada Innovation did an amazing job building out our core blockchain
  infrastructure and I’m sure once PlaceboCoin rallies they’ll be able to finish
  the project.
