## Overview

RegNXT came to us because their existing banking software was giving them headaches. Their team was spending hours fixing data errors, dealing with system crashes, and struggling with a clunky interface that made simple tasks take forever.

The biggest problems they faced were:

- Data errors slipping through and causing compliance issues
- No way to track changes or go back to previous versions
- A confusing interface that required extensive training
- Slow performance that frustrated users

### Better Data Tracking

We built a simple system that keeps track of all changes. Now users can:

- See what changed and when
- Quickly fix mistakes by going back to previous versions
- Know exactly who made what changes
- Feel confident their data is always accurate

### Visual Data Connections

Instead of wrestling with complex spreadsheets, we created a visual tool where users can:

- See how different pieces of data connect
- Drag and drop to create new connections
- Spot problems at a glance
- Share clear diagrams with their team

### Smart Error Checking

We added automatic checks that:

- Catch mistakes before they cause problems
- Show clear, helpful error messages
- Make it obvious what needs fixing
- Save hours of manual checking

  cash out their pensions.

## What Made It Work

1. **Simple Design**
